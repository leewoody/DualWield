Dual Wield shows notifications from your iPhone on your Android phone. It will connect them together wirelessly and securely, and mirror every notification on your iPhone to your Android phone. 

Every notification posted on your iPhone will also show up on your Android phone, which means it can also show iPhone notifications on your Android Wear / WearOS smartwatch, Android Auto, etc. This is for lazy people who carry around two phones but only want to check one.

It does not sync notifications the other way; i.e. notifications from your Android phone will not show up on your iPhone.
